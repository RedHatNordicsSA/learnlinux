# Troubleshooting and performance tuning
Troubleshooting and performance tuning are together with security the most complex topics you will deal with in Linux.

If you have made it here, this material was probably a bit too easy for you, or perhaps you did a bit too much copy-and-paste ðŸ˜‰
Here's are two bonus topics for you anyhow, where you should spend the rest of this lab. If you complete these two today, you likely didn't understand what you where doing.

With no further wait, here are two legendary guides written mainly by Red Hat's Marko Myllynen.
