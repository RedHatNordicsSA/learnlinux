# Navigating in Linux

In this lab, you'll learn the basics about how to navigate in Linux and to use basic commands to manipulate your environment.

## Linux and command line interface fundamentals

When you have connected to your system, you will see a prompt which looks something like this:
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136 ~]$
```
This represents your connection to the Linux command line based user interface on your system, also commonly called a ```shell```.
How your prompt looks like differs from system to system based on how the shell is configured. 
There are many different types of shells, with some different capabilities which are of less interest to us at this point.
The most commonly used shell in Linux is the Bourn Again SHell or BASH, which is what you are using now.

### Setting and viewing variables

The look of our shell is controlled by a so called environment variable called PS1. 
Wait, what? Yes, environment variables. Variable? A variable is a thing which can store information, like this:

```
testvariable=5
linuxrules="a variable can also store text strings"
```

üí• Let's test and set a variable in our shell and then use it. We are going to set a variable and then fetch the content of it. Run below command to set your variable.
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136 ~]$ reminder="I should go for a an hours walk every day"
```

üí• Next, we are going to fetch the value of the variable and print it out on the screen. We do that by running the command ```echo```, which prints things to the screen.

Run below commands:
```
echo $reminder
```

Expected output:
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136 ~]$ echo $reminder
I should go for a an hours walk every day
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136 ~]$ 
```

Now, why did we spend time on learning this? Because variables is a common way to configure applications and set behavior in Linux.

Now that you understand the concept of variables, we're going to have a look at the variable which controlls how your prompt looks like.

üí• Using the same command (```echo```) we'll now look at the PS1 environment variable.

Run below commands:
```
echo $PS1
```

Expected output:
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136 ~]$ echo $PS1
[\u@\h \W]\$
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136 ~]$
```

üí• Change the PS1 environment variable to include some additional information like time and where you are. By using the export command, we can expose the change to the current shell session we are in.

Run below commands:
```
export PS1="[\u@\h:\t:\w]\$ "
```

Expected output:
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136 ~]$ export PS1="[\u@\h:\t:\w]\$ "
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:20:20:49:~]$ 
```

‚ùó Please note that the change to the PS1 variable which we did above is not permanent, the next time we connect, the change will not be there.

### Environment variables, looking at content of files and manual pages
Environment variables are variables which are set in a user's shell session. In the BASH shell, which you are using, they are normally set in one out of three files.

```
/etc/bashrc
/etc/profile
/home/user/.bashrc
/etc/profile.d/something
```

To have a look at these files, we can use the ```cat```or concatenate command, which prints the contents of files.

üí• Run below command to display the content of the file ```/etc/bashrc``` and /home/user/.bashrc. 
```
cat /etc/bashrc
```
üëç Please note that instead of writing /home/user/.bashrc we are typing ~/.bashrc instead. ```~``` is shorthand for home directory and allows us to not hardcode the name of the user in this example.

Expected output:
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:20:35:36:~]$ cat /etc/bashrc
# /etc/bashrc

# System wide functions and aliases
# Environment stuff goes in /etc/profile

# It's NOT a good idea to change this file unless you know what you
# are doing. It's much better to create a custom.sh shell script in
# /etc/profile.d/ to make custom changes to your environment, as this
# will prevent the need for merging in future updates.
...
```

If we are to change environment variables, we're getting some advise here in the start of the /etc/bashrc file, which is to put environment variables somewhere else.
Those other places are:
```
/etc/profile.d/something.sh
or
~/.bashrc
```

So, environment variables can be set in many different places, how do we then easily tell what is set to what?
There is a command for that, luckily.

üí• Use the ```env``` command to display all environment variables in your shell session.

Run below commands:
```
env
```

Example output:
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:22:07:07:~]$ env
...
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
HISTCONTROL=ignoredups
HOSTNAME=ip-172-31-31-136.eu-central-1.compute.internal
XDG_SESSION_ID=5
USER=ec2-user
PWD=/home/ec2-user
HOME=/home/ec2-user
SHELL=/bin/bash
XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus
SELINUX_USE_CURRENT_RANGE=
SHLVL=1
LOGNAME=ec2-user
DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/1000/bus
XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000
PATH=/home/ec2-user/.local/bin:/home/ec2-user/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin
PS1=[\u@\h:\t:\w]$
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:22:14:20:~]$
```

Let's review some of the more important ones of the environment variables, which are below:
```
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
HOSTNAME=ip-172-31-31-136.eu-central-1.compute.internal
HOME=/home/ec2-user
SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/home/ec2-user/.local/bin:/home/ec2-user/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:22:14:20:~]$
```
So, what do we got here?
```
LANG sets the language and locale for your system.
HOSTNAME sets what the hostname of the system is.
HOME sets your home directory
SHELL sets what your shell is
PATH sets in what places the system should look for commands in. Meaning, all the commands you run in this lab, are programs located in one of the defined directories set in PATH. Note that directories are separated with the : character.
```

### listing files and permissions
The most common command used in Linux is ```ls```. It helps you show files.
Let's try it out to further explore the files which sets environment variables. First we need to find out where we are on the Linux filesystem.

üí• Use ```pwd``` to Print Working Directory, meaning printing out where you are currently.

Run below commands:
```
pwd
```

Expected output:
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:20:40:34:~]$ pwd
/home/ec2-user
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:20:55:42:~]$ 
```

üí• Let's see if we can find ~/.bashrc, a file located in our home directory. In your terminal, run the ```list directory``` command:

```
ls
```

Above lists all files located where we are currently.

Expected example output:
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136 ~]$ ls
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136 ~]$
```

That was perhaps not what we expected. We got nothing. The reason for this is because files which starts with ```.``` in their names, such as .bashrc are automatically hidden. To show hidden files we need to provide an argument to the ```ls``` command. But what argument?
Introducing ```manual pages``` or ```man pages```. In Linux, most commands comes with a so called manual pages. 

üí• Access the manual pages for the ls command. To exit the manual page, press q.

Run below commands:
```
man ls
```

Expected example output:
```
LS(1)                                                                                                         User Commands                                                                                                        LS(1)

NAME
       ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).  Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --all
              do not ignore entries starting with .
```

‚ùó To exit the manual page, press q.

Now we know how to find hidden files.

üí• Look at all the hidden files in your home directory.

Run below commands:
```
ls -a
```

Expected output:
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:21:05:51:~]$ ls -a
.  ..  .bash_history  .bash_logout  .bash_profile  .bashrc  .ssh
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:21:05:54:~]$ 
```

üí• We have found the .bashrc file. Let's see what more we can learn. Add the ```-l``` switch to the ls command. 
```
ls -la
```

Example output:
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:21:11:12:~]$ ls -la
total 16
drwx------. 3 ec2-user ec2-user  95 Oct 11 18:32 .
drwxr-xr-x. 3 root     root      22 Oct 11 07:46 ..
-rw-------. 1 ec2-user ec2-user  15 Oct 11 18:32 .bash_history
-rw-r--r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user  18 Apr 21 14:04 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user 141 Apr 21 14:04 .bash_profile
-rw-r--r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user 376 Apr 21 14:04 .bashrc
drwx------. 2 ec2-user ec2-user  29 Oct 11 07:46 .ssh
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:21:15:08:~]$ 
```

Let's take some time to break down what we are looking at here. First off, we can can see what user and what group owns what file.
```
-rw-r--r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user 376 Apr 21 14:04 .bashrc
```

Next we can also see some other things, for example, at what date the file was created and to the far left, what permissions are set for this file.
Permissions are displayed as follows:
* The very first position indicates special permissions, such as if what we are looking at is a directory, a link or has special access to the system.
* The first three positions, in our example starting at the first r, indicates permissions for the user who owns the file.
* The second three positions, in our example starting with r, indicates permissions for the group which owns the file
* The third three positions, in our example starting with r, indicates permissions for others, meaning everyone who does _not_ own the file.
* 
Permissions which can be set are r and as read, w as in write and x as in execute. If you see -, that means a permission is not set.
So, in our example:
```
-rw-r--r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user 376 Apr 21 14:04 .bashrc
```
Means that the user which owns this file, ec2-user, can read and write to this file.
Means that the group which owns this file, also called ec2-user, can read this file.
Means that everyone who does not own this file, can read this file.

üí• Let's look at something else, at our home directory.

Run below commands:
```
ls -la /home
```

Example output:
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:21:15:08:~]$ ls -la /home
total 0
drwxr-xr-x.  3 root     root      22 Oct 11 07:46 .
dr-xr-xr-x. 18 root     root     236 May  4 17:30 ..
drwx------.  3 ec2-user ec2-user  95 Oct 11 18:32 ec2-user
```

Here we can see the first position being set to ```d```, that means we are looking at a directory called ec2-user.
The first three positions are set to ```rwx```, which means that the user who owns this directory has read, write and execute rights to the directory.
In order to enter into a directory, you need both read and execute rights.

### Changing permissions on files

To change permissions for files and directories, first you need to have write access to them.

üí• Create a new file called secrets in your home directory which we can manipulate.

Run below commands:
```
echo "I still do not like broccoli" >secrets
```

Expected output:
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:21:30:55:~]$ echo "I still do not like broccoli" >secret
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:21:42:21:~]$
```

Above uses the echo command, which prints text to the terminal to create a file. We do this by using a built in function in our shell, which redirects the text we print from the standard output device, to a file called secrets. This is useful, as almost any command's output can be redirected in a file in this way.

üí• Let's have a look at the file, by using the ```cat``` command again.

Run below commands:
```
cat secret
```

Expected output:
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:21:46:33:~]$ cat secret
I still do not like broccoli
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:21:46:34:~]$ 
```

To change permissions on files, we use the ```chmod``` command. Use ```man chmod``` to find out more about how it works.
The different people we can give permissions to, if you remember, is: user, group, other. In the command we refer to them as such:
```
u      user
g      group
o      other
```
In short, we pass who or whom we are setting permissions for first and then what permissions to set for them.

For example:
```
chmod u+r
```
Means, give the user who owns the file read rights. We can also combined and assign right to several entities at the same time, as such:

```
chmod ug+rw
```

Above, we assign read and write access to both the user and the group which owns a file.

üí• Now, let's remove the read access to our secret file.

Run below commands:
```
chmod ug-r secret
```

üí• Try to see the content of the file, using ```cat```.

Run below commands:
```
cat secret
```

Expected output:
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:21:58:12:~]$ cat secret
cat: secret: Permission denied
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:21:58:15:~]$ 
```

üí• Now let's change the permissions so that user and group can read the file again.
```
chmod ug+r secret
```

Did you think about something? What set the permissions in the first place? When you created the file:
umask.
TODO


‚ùó Setting correct permissions on files is a security fundamental in Linux. But before you run off to remove read, write and execute permissions for anyone who is not an owner of a file on your Linux system, wait. If you do that, you will most likely break your system. Why is that? Because a lot of programs rely on being able to read files they don't own. For example, to be able to understand if a system has a specific setting or not which the program needs to adopt to.

To conclude, to be able to set permissions on a need-to-know basis, we need to know a lot about both the system and the programs running on it.

üí• Let's have a look at an example of a critical, but world readable file.

Run below commands:
```
cat /etc/selinux/config
```

Expected output:
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:22:03:41:~]$ ls -la /etc/selinux/config 
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 548 May  4 17:28 /etc/selinux/config
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:22:03:53:~]$ 

```

This file, which controls if SELinux (an important security feature we'll cover more) should be turned on or off and how, is readable to everyone on the system.

üí• Let's imagine we are a bad actor and try to overwrite this file with nothing.

Run below commands:
```
echo "" >/etc/selinux/config
```

Expected output:
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:22:03:53:~]$ echo "" >/etc/selinux/config
-bash: /etc/selinux/config: Permission denied
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-31-136:22:07:07:~]$ 
```
